00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:43.920
有关触摸类型和位置的信息会

在几毫秒内发送到大脑，

00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:48.639
milliseconds

332
00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:53.519
同时 c-触觉传入神经

一到两秒后

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.480
到达大脑，更准确地说是

337
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.320
大脑负责处理

338
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.560
积极情绪的区域我们如何看待

339
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.440
他人
others

340
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.600
和自我认知
and self-perception

341
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.880
我认为这是将社会群体粘合
i think it's what glues social groups

342
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.480
在一起的原因
together so this touch is playing a

343
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.680
在调节
fundamental role in in regulating

344
00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.320
the the reward of

345
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.480
群体中社交接触的奖励方面发挥作用，当你们
social contact in groups and when you're

346
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.040
在一起时，你们更有能力
together you're far more able to deal

347
00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.639
应对来自外部

348
00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:30.399
环境的压力，就像缺失的
environment it's like the missing

349
00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:32.480
粒子一样，让
particle that's allowed us to understand

350
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.720
我们??了解社交大脑
just what the social brain

351
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.399
真正激发的是什么
really fuels off

352
00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:38.639
就是这种触觉神经将
and that is this touch nerve that brings

353
00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:41.600
所有东西聚集在一起
everything together

354
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.759
也许海触觉传入被
perhaps the sea tactile afferents were

355
00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:45.440
发现这么晚是因为它们
discovered so late because they are

356
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.600
很难
difficult to find

357
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.839
找到迪斯科舞厅 如此巨大的规模需要
a discovery of this magnitude requires

358
00:15:49.839 --> 00:15:52.480
真正的专家，比如在瑞典的 ling coop
real specialists like here in ling coop

359
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.639
in sweden

360
00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:59.600
一根纸一样细的针穿过
a paper-thin needle pierces through the

361
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.040
皮肤进入手臂的神经，
skin into a nerve in the arm

362
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.880
问题是神经中有许多
the problem is that there are many

363
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.120
不同的纤维，它们
different fibers in the nerve which can

364
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.880
可以连接到非常不同的感受器，
be connected to very different receptors

365
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.480
所以 这是找到合适的问题，
so it's a matter of finding the right

366
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.240
one

367
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.240
但在纤维最终对轻柔的抚摸刺激做出反应
but what is the fiber reacting to

368
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.240
exactly

369
00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:25.519
之前，纤维对针的准确反应是什么？
the needle is corrected until a fiber

370
00:16:25.519 --> 00:16:27.759
finally responds to the gentle stroking

371
00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:29.600
stimuli

372
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.079
这是一个耗时的过程，
it is a time-consuming procedure

373
00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:36.040
通常需要数小时，
usually taking hours

374
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.399
但
but it pays off

375
00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:40.560
研究人员最终可以确定
the researcher can finally determine to

376
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.959
what the sea tactile afferents respond

377
00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:45.360
best

378
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.720
当您
when you press gently with low force

379
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.279
像这样以缓慢的抚摸速度用较小的力轻轻按压时，海洋触觉传入的反应最佳
with a slow stroking velocity like this

380
00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:54.079
它们被调整为对皮肤上的这种抚摸做出最佳反应
they are tuned to respond optimally to

381
00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:56.959
this kind of stroke over the skin

382
00:16:56.959 --> 00:16:58.959
因此我们认为这些触觉
and so we think that these see tactile

383
00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:00.240
纤维
fibers

384
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.959
给了我们一种积极的感觉 有效的
give us a sense of positive effective

385
00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:05.359
触摸，所以它是令人愉快的触摸
touch and so it's pleasant touch

386
00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.760
所以当我们抚摸皮肤时太快
and so when we if we stroke the skin too

387
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.959
fast

388
00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:10.559
或
or too slowly

389
00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:13.280
太慢都不是最佳的，但如果我们
it's not optimal but if we stroke it

390
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.000
轻柔地抚摸它 爱抚皮肤
like a gentle caress of the skin

391
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.799
可以最佳地激活这些纤维，
it optimally activates these fibers and

392
00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:20.240
我们认为这就是您
we think that this is how you gain

393
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.359
从触摸中获得乐趣
pleasure out of touch

394
00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:26.079
的方式所谓的抚摸机器人实验
the so-called stroking robot experiments

395
00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:28.000
表明，
demonstrate this

396
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.320
它可以用于
it can be used to test different touches

397
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.799
以完全相同的方式在每个测试

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.320
对象上测试不同的触摸 通过 c 触觉传入接收到的信号
the more signals received via the c

400
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.880
越多，
tactile afferents the more pleasant the

401
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.559
测试对象感知到的触摸
test subjects perceive the touch

402
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.919
越愉快，效果在 34 摄氏度时最强，
the effect is strongest at 34 degrees

403
00:17:47.919 --> 00:17:49.360
celsius

404
00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.600
与我们的指尖温度相同
the same temperature as our fingertips

405
00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.679
有趣的是
and interestingly there's more of these

406
00:17:57.679 --> 00:17:59.440
nerve fibers here

407
00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.039
背部的神经纤维比

前臂的神经纤维多，
forearm

409
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.080
所以 为什么人们喜欢好好按摩他们的背部
so why do people like having their back

410
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.000
他们喜欢好好按摩他们的背部
massage well they like having their back

411
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.440
因为从进化的角度来说那里有更多的这些

in evolutionary terms

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.200
为什么你要在背部井上放一个奖励触摸系统
why would you put a reward touch system

415
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.840
你不能回到你的
on the back well you can't get to your

解释为什么我们会觉得触觉如此愉快，

428
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.160
因为同样的刺激——轻柔

这就是为什么我们的大脑必须学习的第一件事

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.640
就是区分是我们还是
to learn is to distinguish whether we or

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.640
其他人在抚摸我们，
someone else is touching us

437
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.400
因为这会对我们的大脑产生巨大的影响
because that makes a huge difference to

438
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.010
our brain

[音乐]
[Music]

440
00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:21.679
当我抚摸我的手臂时，我的大脑可以
when i stroke my arm my brain can sort

441
00:19:21.679 --> 00:19:23.440
预测会发生
of predict what's going to happen how

442
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.440
什么 当我抚摸我的手臂时它会感觉如何
it's going to feel when i stroke my arm

443
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.520
而发生的事情是大脑随后
and what happens is that the brain then

444
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.919
屏蔽了这些信息
blocks out this information

445
00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.760
所以就好像大脑抑制了
so it's as if the brain suppresses the

446
00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.840
当我抚摸自己的手臂时发生的感觉
feeling that occurs when i stroke my own

447
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.799
arm

448
00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:36.720
并且它通过知道来做到这一点 会发生什么
and it does that by knowing what's going

449
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.840
to happen

450
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.360
所以它实际上
and so it actually doesn't even matter

451
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.679
对我们来说并不重要，
to us

452
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.320
所以我们不会有意识地感知
so we don't consciously perceive the

453
00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.520
触摸，
touches

454
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.360
但我们经常触摸自己

constantly

456
00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.960
mostly on the face

457
00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.440
每天在脸上触摸 400 到 800 次

该假设是如果这在

生物学上来说是无关紧要的，如果这

464
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.440
是不必要的触摸，
is an unnecessary touch

465
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.080
那么大脑就会发生生理变化
then physiological changes in the brain

466
00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.159
不会出现，

467

在物理层面上对我们很重要的触摸刺激，
important for us on a physical level

469
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.240
那么大脑中应该有相应的

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.559
of it

1193
00:51:24.559 --> 00:51:26.559
