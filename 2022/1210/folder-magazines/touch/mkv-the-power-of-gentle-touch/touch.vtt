00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.720
actually use touch to learn and feel

60
00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.640
important at the beginning of life that

61
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.720

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.480
now somehow belong to this community

with these other people

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.920

communicate to him appears on a screen

of course you can also try to convey

you actually feel is something else

someone hey i love you

120
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.240
hugging kissing or cuddling with them

121
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.639
above all we are better able to convey

122
00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.280
love and compassion through touch than

123
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.360

125
00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.199

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:08.080
how has the fact that we now have to

128
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.720
keep our distance affected us and our

129
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.600
relationships

130
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.520
it just creates barriers it creates

131
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.960
barriers between people and so if you

132
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.360
cannot reach out and touch someone

133
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.840
it means you lack that

134
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.400
interaction with them and

135
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.400
it means that we can't reinforce our

136
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.520
social bonds and this is especially true

137
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.520
at the moment for younger people who are

138
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.600
learning how to interact

139
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.560
and so in a normal world we would shake

140
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.440
hands or hug or kiss especially children

141
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.919
and now we have to tell them no no you

142
00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:49.280
can't do it

143
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.440

144
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.240
on social relationships that we make for

145
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.160
the moment but it could have bigger

146
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.840
implications for the future as well

147
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.400
just reaching your hand out to another

148
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.720

149
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.080

be relaxing but it's also something that

we need it's essential for life because

165
00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:39.759
if we didn't have reward in touch if we

166
00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.840
didn't find it pleasurable we wouldn't

167
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.319

closeness and

198
00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:56.080
touch if animals only received basic

died

201
00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.360
and those that survived suffered

202
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.600
irreparable psychological and physical

203
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.680
damage

204
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.839
they showed reduced body growth

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:10.240
underdeveloped immune systems and an

206
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.640
inability to perform even the simplest

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.600
memory functions

208
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.480
central areas in the brain were impaired

[Music]

211
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.560
because touch has a very direct effect

212
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.160
on our brains

213
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.399
it is essential for us to develop a

214
00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:37.800
sense of self

215
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.320
physical contact sets important

216
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.040
developmental processes in motion and

217
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.839
also stimulates

218
00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:52.000
growth when a baby is touched millions

219
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.320
of receptors in the skin react and

220
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.720
produce very small currents

221
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.560
these microcurrents reach different

222
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.200
regions of the brain via a dense network

223
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.440
of nerve fibers

224
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.279
when the electrical impulses connect

225
00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:07.839
with specialized nerve cells there their

226
00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:10.079
memory gates open

227
00:10:10.079 --> 00:10:13.040
signal molecules are released

228
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.040
they trigger growth-promoting processes

229
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.360
directly in the other nerve cells or

230
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.440
they can reach cells via the blood and

231
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.959
trigger growth processes there

232
00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:25.920
in the famine

233
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.519
this is how touch always produces a

234
00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:32.240
reaction throughout the body

235
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.959
it changes our organism

236
00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:37.680
we see this not only in babies but also

237
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.440
in adults

238
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.440

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.480
affects all aspects of our biology and

brain waves are recorded before during

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.040
martin grunvald has been interested in

245
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.399
gentle touch since the early 1990s

246
00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:06.640
back then the topic was basically still

247
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.480
uncharted territory for the scientific

248
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.480

249
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.320
how does a massage change brain activity

250
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.399
the eeg measurements show that brain

251
00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:18.560
waves slow down

252
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.399
the result is a profound state of

253
00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:23.040
relaxation similar to when a person is

254
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.760
fast asleep

255
00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:28.480
however the brain not only becomes less

256
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.440
active

257
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.839
it also releases a cocktail of messenger

258
00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:33.300
signals

259
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.440
[Music]

260
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.360
when hormones and neurotransmitters are

261
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.000
released certain messenger chemicals go

262
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.160
on to reach the other areas of the body

263
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.760
through the bloodstream

264
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.480
this process leads to among other things

265
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.959
muscle relaxation a decrease in heart

266
00:11:50.959 --> 00:11:53.600
rate and shallower breathing

267
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.440
there is a whole host of physical

268
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.839
changes

269
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.600
every single touch literally goes under

270
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.140
our skin

271
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.289
[Music]

272
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.320
we often overlook visual or acoustic

273
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.600
stimuli

274
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.240
but this is never the case with touch

275
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.320
because recognizing someone's touch and

276
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.560
analyzing it is essential for our

277
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.560
survival

278
00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:29.519
in a millisecond our brains can

279
00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:32.079
determine whether or not a touch poses a

280
00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:34.399
threat

281
00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:37.839
millions of receptors in our skin react

00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:41.279
they register pressure vibration heat

286
00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:49.600

287
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.240
very special type of nerve fiber it

pleasant touch

290
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.360
these fibers do not provide us with

information about our external world

292
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.240

293
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.440
liked the touch or not

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.839
the discovery of these so-called sea

295

tactile afferents gives insight into

296
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.040
exactly how significant it touches for

297
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.079
our social lives

304
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.000
and i can remember the moment

305
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.079
i was reading a paper by what i would

306
00:13:44.079 --> 00:13:46.800
say my one of my heroes in neuroscience

307
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.959
a professor aqua valbo

308
00:13:48.959 --> 00:13:50.880
and orca valvo in this paper had

309
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.880
discovered a nerve fiber in the skin of

310
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.000
humans

311
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.079
called the c tactile afferent that

312
00:13:56.079 --> 00:13:58.480
responded to gentle touch and when i was

313
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.199
reading that paper i was on a aeroplane

314
00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:03.680
flying out of washington i could see

315
00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.920
washington memorial on my through my

316
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.639
window and i was reading that paper and

317
00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:10.800
i just at that moment a penny dropped i

318
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.880
thought i know exactly what that nerve

319
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.000
fiber is basically responding to from

320
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.399
that was 1995 or 96 and since then

321
00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:22.560
i've been fortunate enough to

322
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.440
pursue my passion in characterizing and

323
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.600
understanding just what this nerdfighter

324
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.040
does and how vital it is

325
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.320
to our well-being

326
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.639
this finding led to the discovery of a

327
00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:39.120
totally new sensory system

328
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.519
when we are gently touched information

329
00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:43.920
about the type and location of the touch

330
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.839
is sent to the brain in a matter of

331
00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:48.639
milliseconds

332
00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:53.519
at the same time c-tactile afferents

333
00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:55.600
also react

334
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.600
their signals only reach the brain after

335
00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.920
one to two seconds

336
00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.480
to be more exact to areas of the brain

337
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.320
that are responsible for processing

338
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.560
positive feelings how we think about

339
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.440
others

340
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.600
and self-perception

341
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.880
i think it's what glues social groups

342
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.480
together so this touch is playing a

343
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.680
fundamental role in in regulating

344
00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.320
the the reward of

345
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.480
social contact in groups and when you're

346
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.040
together you're far more able to deal

347
00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.639
with stresses from the outside

348
00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:30.399
environment it's like the missing

349
00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:32.480
particle that's allowed us to understand

350
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.720
just what the social brain

351
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.399
really fuels off

352
00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:38.639
and that is this touch nerve that brings

353
00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:41.600
everything together

354
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.759
perhaps the sea tactile afferents were

355
00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:45.440
discovered so late because they are

356
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.600
difficult to find

357
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.839
a discovery of this magnitude requires

358
00:15:49.839 --> 00:15:52.480
real specialists like here in ling coop

359
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.639
in sweden

360
00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:59.600
a paper-thin needle pierces through the

361
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.040
skin into a nerve in the arm

362
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.880
the problem is that there are many

363
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.120
different fibers in the nerve which can

364
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.880
be connected to very different receptors

365
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.480
so it's a matter of finding the right

366
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.240
one

367
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.240
but what is the fiber reacting to

368
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.240
exactly

369
00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:25.519
the needle is corrected until a fiber

370
00:16:25.519 --> 00:16:27.759
finally responds to the gentle stroking

371
00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:29.600
stimuli

372
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.079
it is a time-consuming procedure

373
00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:36.040
usually taking hours

374
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.399
but it pays off

375
00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:40.560
the researcher can finally determine to

376
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.959
what the sea tactile afferents respond

377
00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:45.360
best

378
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.720
when you press gently with low force

379
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.279
with a slow stroking velocity like this

380
00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:54.079
they are tuned to respond optimally to

381
00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:56.959
this kind of stroke over the skin

382
00:16:56.959 --> 00:16:58.959
and so we think that these see tactile

383
00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:00.240
fibers

384
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.959
give us a sense of positive effective

385
00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:05.359
touch and so it's pleasant touch

386
00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.760
and so when we if we stroke the skin too

387
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.959
fast

388
00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:10.559
or too slowly

389
00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:13.280
it's not optimal but if we stroke it

390
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.000
like a gentle caress of the skin

391
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.799
it optimally activates these fibers and

392
00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:20.240
we think that this is how you gain

393
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.359
pleasure out of touch

394
00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:26.079
the so-called stroking robot experiments

395
00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:28.000
demonstrate this

396
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.320
it can be used to test different touches

397
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.799
in exactly the same way on each test

398
00:17:32.799 --> 00:17:35.280
subject

399
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.320
the more signals received via the c

400
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.880
tactile afferents the more pleasant the

401
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.559
test subjects perceive the touch

402
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.919
the effect is strongest at 34 degrees

403
00:17:47.919 --> 00:17:49.360
celsius

404
00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.600
the same temperature as our fingertips

405
00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.679
and interestingly there's more of these

406
00:17:57.679 --> 00:17:59.440
nerve fibers here

407
00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.039
on the back than there are in the

408
00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:02.240
forearm

409
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.080
so why do people like having their back

410
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.000
massage well they like having their back

411
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.440
massage because there's more of these

412
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.120
nerve fibers there

413
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.120
in evolutionary terms

414
00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.200
why would you put a reward touch system

415
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.840
on the back well you can't get to your

416
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.160
back to groom it so you need to get

417
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.919
somebody else another primate needs to

418
00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:22.510
come along and groom your back

419
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.080
[Music]

420
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.720
another indication that touch plays a

421
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.950
social role

422
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:32.559
[Music]

423
00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:35.120
this highly complex system of receptors

424
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.520
and nerve fibers connects us with our

425
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.720
environment and other people

426
00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:46.320
but see tactile afferents alone cannot

427
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.760
explain why we find touch so pleasant

428
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.160
because the same stimulus the gentle

429
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.679
touch of the skin

430
00:18:53.679 --> 00:18:55.280
can trigger completely different

431
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.320
reactions depending on the situation and

432
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.600
who is touching us

433
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.080
[Music]

434
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.160
that's why the first thing our brain has

435
00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.640
to learn is to distinguish whether we or

436
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.640
someone else is touching us

437
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.400
because that makes a huge difference to

438
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.010
our brain

439
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.769
[Music]

440
00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:21.679
when i stroke my arm my brain can sort

441
00:19:21.679 --> 00:19:23.440
of predict what's going to happen how

442
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.440
it's going to feel when i stroke my arm

443
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.520
and what happens is that the brain then

444
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.919
blocks out this information

445
00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.760
so it's as if the brain suppresses the

446
00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.840
feeling that occurs when i stroke my own

447
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.799
arm

448
00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:36.720
and it does that by knowing what's going

449
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.840
to happen

450
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.360
and so it actually doesn't even matter

451
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.679
to us

452
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.320
so we don't consciously perceive the

453
00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.520
touches

454
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.360
nevertheless we touch ourselves

455
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.880
constantly

456
00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.960
mostly on the face

457
00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.440
between 400 and 800 times a day

458
00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.880
why

459
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.640
to answer this question martin

460
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.960
gruenvald's research group in leipzig

461
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.240
came up with an intriguing study

462
00:20:09.679 --> 00:20:12.480
the hypothesis was if this is all just

463
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.360
biologically speaking irrelevant if this

464
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.440
is an unnecessary touch

465
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.080
then physiological changes in the brain

466
00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.159
will not show up

467
00:20:22.159 --> 00:20:25.039
but if this is a touch stimulus which is

468
00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:27.600
important for us on a physical level

469
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.240
then there should be corresponding

470
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.720
neurophysiological changes in the brain

471
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.200
and this is exactly what we have shown

472
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.360
now

473
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.520
the test subjects are given the task to

474
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.159
feel different patterns on small plates

475
00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:46.159
remember the structures and record them

476
00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:49.159
later

477
00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.880
they do not know that they are being

478
00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.640
filmed while doing this

479
00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.159
so that their brain waves can be

480
00:20:54.159 --> 00:20:56.320
evaluated in parallel with their self

481
00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.320
touching

482
00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:05.840
when they try to remember what they have

483
00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.240
felt they suddenly hear some disturbing

484
00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.240
noises

485
00:21:17.679 --> 00:21:20.400
the eeg reveals just how stressed the

486
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.360
test subjects are

487
00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.260
[Music]

488
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.799
[Applause]

489
00:21:24.799 --> 00:21:26.799
this gives researchers their first

490
00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:29.360
chance to see in a laboratory setting

491
00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.440
how the organism regulates itself in

492
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.840
this way

493
00:21:34.799 --> 00:21:36.720
the annoying sounds disrupt their

494
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.240
concentration

495
00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.919
all of the information stored in their

496
00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:41.679
memory gets lost

497
00:21:41.679 --> 00:21:44.799
they feel overwhelmed

498
00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:47.200
and it is exactly at such a moment that

499
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.159
self-touching frequently occurs

500
00:21:50.159 --> 00:21:52.640
the evaluation of brain waves shows how

501
00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.000
short touch regulates brain activity

502
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.760
it goes back to a medium level of

503
00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.960
arousal

504
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.280
as a result the test subjects can better

505
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.400
focus on the task at hand

506
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.799
and i think that's the first step

507
00:22:18.799 --> 00:22:20.720
but when it comes to the processes

508
00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.159
behind it

509
00:22:22.159 --> 00:22:24.159
which parts of the brain trigger other

510
00:22:24.159 --> 00:22:26.400
areas in the brain to make your hands

511
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.760
touch your face

512
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.480
so you can feel better

513
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.039
it's all a bit unclear

514
00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:35.280
now but the question where does that

515
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.919
impulse to touch ourselves come from

516
00:22:37.919 --> 00:22:40.080
is a very interesting philosophical

517
00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.400
question

518
00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:49.600
touch comes from outside and works deep

519
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.159
within us

520
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.650
it keeps us emotionally balanced

521
00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.600
[Music]

522
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.640
and yet

523
00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.919
self-touch

524
00:22:59.919 --> 00:23:02.240
cannot replace the touch of another

525
00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.890
person

526
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.679
[Music]

527
00:23:05.679 --> 00:23:07.520
but why is it different when we are

528
00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.240
touched

529
00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.320
[Music]

530
00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.880
and why does the same stimulus trigger

531
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.960
so many different reactions in our brain

532
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.520
from the greatest feelings of joy to

533
00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.760
deep aversion

534
00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.440
a caress can comfort calm and lower the

535
00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.720
heart rate

536
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.120
for example if your best friend is in

537
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.120
distress

538
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.799
and a caress can also trigger us in

539
00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:40.000
different ways

540
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.200
for example

541
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.600
when we're in love

542
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.360
then our pulse rises

543
00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.679
we're aroused

544
00:23:47.679 --> 00:23:50.080
because every single touch sends lots of

545
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.640
different information to our brain

546
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:57.689
[Music]

547
00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.120
for example vibration pressure the

548
00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.440
duration of touch so the qualities of

549
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.559
the touch but then it's also evaluated

550
00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:09.120
and so it's also how did that touch make

551
00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.200
me feel did i like it

552
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.279
do i want more of the touch and so the

553
00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:15.679
brain actually puts together all this

554
00:24:15.679 --> 00:24:18.799
information to deliver a whole a rounded

555
00:24:18.799 --> 00:24:22.080
experience for touch

556
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.640
rebecca buma is investigating exactly

557
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.039
how and where this happens at the center

558
00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:32.640
for medical image science and

559
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.600
visualization in lean cooping

560
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.360
today she wants to see not only the

561
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:42.240
brain but also the spinal cord at work

562
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.520
her theory the spinal cord might play a

563
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.679
much bigger role in processing touch

564
00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:53.520
stimuli than previously thought

565
00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.039
i think what is particularly exciting

566
00:25:01.039 --> 00:25:03.120
about this is that we are now focusing a

567
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.039
little less on the brain

568
00:25:05.039 --> 00:25:07.039
for a very long time neuroscience

569
00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:09.200
revolved exclusively around everything

570
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.520
happening in the brain and we completely

571
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.120
disregarded the whole interaction

572
00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.880
between brain and body and the

573
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.000
physiology of the body

574
00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:21.600
before the signals from the sea tactile

575
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.240
afferents even reach the brain they must

576
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.720
first arrive in the spinal cord in the

577
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.960

here the information i am being touched

579
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.720
is conveyed to other nerve cells

580
00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.520
mainly interneurons which transmit and

581
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.640
process the information

582
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.720
only a few nerve cells then send

583
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.919
messages up to the brain

584
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.000
what is interesting here is that the

585
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.400
interneurons in the spinal cord receive

586
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.400
information from the brain

587
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.320
and this could impact our perception of

588
00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.640
touch in the spinal cord depending on

589
00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.640
the situation we are in and who is

590
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.120
touching us

595
00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.700
touched

[Music]

597
00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.000
the brain scans show that when the

598
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.640
subject touches himself activity in some

599
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.120
areas is significantly reduced compared

600
00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.840
to the resting state

601
00:26:27.679 --> 00:26:29.679
but it's quite a different story when

602
00:26:29.679 --> 00:26:32.080
someone is touching us

603
00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.320
many brain regions are clearly activated

604
00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.480
especially regions in which we recognize

605
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.799
the intentions thoughts and plans of

606
00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:43.200
others and which are responsible for

607
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.640
that feeling of reward

608
00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.640
a major difference

609
00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.679
does it also show up in the spinal cord

610
00:26:55.679 --> 00:26:57.360
measurements alternating between the

611
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.960
brain and the spinal cord are now taken

612
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.120
which area becomes activated first

613
00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.799
and how do they influence each other

614
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.279
so if the touch stimuli enter the spinal

615
00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:13.120
cord via the nerves it is already

616
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.440
differentiated here between me and

617
00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.400
others

618
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.720
the brain knows that i'm touching myself

619
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.480
maybe then we'll have less activation in

620
00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.799
the spinal cord the brain knows someone

621
00:27:22.799 --> 00:27:24.720
else is touching me maybe if it is

622
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.399
someone i particularly like

623
00:27:26.399 --> 00:27:28.159
then it may be that the brain actually

624
00:27:28.159 --> 00:27:29.760
increases the activity in the spinal

625
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.840
cord so that we react more sensitively

626
00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.320
to it

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.559

00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:38.240
must be evaluated

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.159
the results could help us develop

innovative approaches to treating mental

anyone who feels a pleasant touch wants

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.440
more of it

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.200
the reward system in our brain is

643
00:28:10.159 --> 00:28:12.240
these include for example

644
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.520
endorphins

645
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.440
the so-called happiness hormones that

646
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.000
give us a high

647
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.919
and also oxytocin

648
00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:21.919
the bonding hormone that makes us feel

649
00:28:21.919 --> 00:28:25.020
close and connected to the other person

651
00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:31.520
this explains why a hug can be so much

652
00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.090
more comforting than words

[Music]

654
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.760
because oxytocin plays a very important

655
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:44.279
role in how we form social bonds

656
00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.320
it is popularly known as the cuddle

657
00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.799

660

but studies carried out on primates show

661
00:28:57.919 --> 00:29:00.080
that oxytocin determines all of our

662
00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.080
long-term social bonds

663
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.480

have sexual interests

665
00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:10.640
a friendship between primates is

666
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.399
expressed primarily through mutual

667
00:29:12.399 --> 00:29:14.399
grooming

668
00:29:14.399 --> 00:29:16.640
particularly high levels of oxytocin are

669
00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.559
released when the two animals also have

670
00:29:18.559 --> 00:29:20.799
intense contact with each other in other

676
00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.200
this makes evolutionary sense because

677
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.279
oxytocin strengthens the need for

678
00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:35.440
closeness and promotes appropriate

679
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.880
social behavior

680
00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.880
and not only in the one who is receiving

681
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.039
loving attention

682
00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:42.880
somebody who's giving touch also has to

683
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.200
be rewarded and that reward i think is

684
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.200
the building of the social relationship

685
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.200
that we discuss with primates grooming

686
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.279

wonderful positive effects making you

otherwise you could say that we should

724
00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.720
give oxytocin to everyone and that will

725
00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.720

778
00:34:00.159 --> 00:34:02.000

behaviors that we're seeing now may well

786
00:34:14.879 --> 00:34:16.639
be a consequence of the fact that we're

787
00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:20.560
not socially touching anymore

788
00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.719
bayata dietsen launched her own study at

789
00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:26.959
the beginning of the lockdown in 2020.

790
00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:30.079
how does social distancing impact us

00:34:30.079 --> 00:34:32.000
is there a direct connection between our

792
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.079
lack of contact and our stress levels

793
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.719
the whole thesis that we say touch can

794
00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:44.560
buffer this could now really be

795
00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.639
investigated and with a really relevant

stressor compared to laboratory stress

797
00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.919

798
00:34:54.079 --> 00:34:56.879
250 households from all over germany

799
00:34:56.879 --> 00:34:59.280
participated in the study

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.560
families singles all age groups

801
00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.640
before starting all test subjects were

802
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:08.160
sent saliva sample tests to their homes

803
00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.680
then they had to answer questions on

804
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.280
different days

805
00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.280
they received these questions as text

806
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.000
messages on their cell phone

807
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.960
do you feel lonely

808
00:35:19.119 --> 00:35:21.520
are you in pain

809
00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.839
do you have physical contact

810
00:35:23.839 --> 00:35:27.520
how nervous and stressed do you feel

811
00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.599
the answers were then directly related

812
00:35:29.599 --> 00:35:32.640
to stress hormones

813
00:35:35.119 --> 00:35:37.680
they took saliva samples while they were

814
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.520
answering these questions

815
00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.200
and this gave us the opportunity to

816
00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.800
combine the individual measurements the

817
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.920
psychobiological information with the

818
00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.240
subject information in this everyday

819
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.359
survey

820
00:35:49.359 --> 00:35:51.280
and because we had a relatively large

821
00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.280
number of test subjects which in turn

822
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.520
produced a lot of measurements we can

823
00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.520
then go on to compare these individual

824
00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.359
measurements with each other and achieve

825
00:35:59.359 --> 00:36:02.000
a statistically significant result

826
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.520
so we don't just have these average

827
00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.839

828
00:36:05.839 --> 00:36:08.160

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:12.440
we have it moment by moment

00:36:13.359 --> 00:36:15.440
the saliva samples are now cooled and

831
00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.160
stored at the institute the evaluation

832
00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.760
begins

833
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.079
what are the cortisol levels like and

834
00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:25.680
how high are the oxytocin levels

835
00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.680
the assumption is that stress hormones

836
00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.520
decrease more rapidly in people who

837
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.079
experience pleasant touch

838
00:36:32.079 --> 00:36:34.480

839
00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.230

this

when we hurt ourselves we automatically

touch and caress the painful area

positive influence on us

883
00:38:28.079 --> 00:38:31.359
it can even inhibit acute pain

884
00:38:31.359 --> 00:38:32.400
for example

885
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.320
when test subjects are confronted with

electrical stimuli or thermal stimuli

887
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:39.359
such as heat stimuli and pain is

888
00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:40.960
triggered as a result

immediately

898
00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.400
for example we can immediately pull our

899
00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.480
hand away from a hot stove top and

900
00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.240
automatically rub our hand over the

901
00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:11.040
painful area

902
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.480
at the same time however the pain signal

903
00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.560
is also sent out via the slower

c-tactile afferent

905
00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.200
if we now rub our hand over the painful

906
00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.920
area the positive caress signals are

907
00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.839
sent at the same time

908
00:39:25.839 --> 00:39:28.000
our brain therefore receives a negative

909
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.359
and a positive signal simultaneously

910
00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.880
and what happens is that when we are

911
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.200
stroked the brain sends the signal down

912
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.599
to lower levels of processing so maybe

913
00:39:43.599 --> 00:39:45.680
in the thalamus or maybe already in the

914
00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:49.119
spinal cord and tells the neurons there

915
00:39:49.119 --> 00:39:52.400
okay calm down we are being stroked

if you don't see people

in person you can't touch them and so i

941

the rise of people working from home

944
00:41:09.359 --> 00:41:11.680
it does decrease the amount of touch

945
00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.079

946
00:41:14.079 --> 00:41:16.560

963
00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.640
does we know this already

964
00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.560
thank god we know that loneliness can

965
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.280
have such serious consequences

966
00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.240
just like smoking and alcohol

967
00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.319
nicotine consumption and alcohol

968
00:42:08.319 --> 00:42:10.800
consumption

969
00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.280
loneliness is just as big of a health

970
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.280
threat

971
00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:21.200
from smoking diabetes pollution etc is

972
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.680
maybe 35 40

973
00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.359
the other race of an early death from

974
00:42:25.359 --> 00:42:29.119
loneliness is something like 45 percent

975
00:42:29.119 --> 00:42:30.960
and that's almost a that's almost a

976
00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.680
global pandemic in its own right but

977
00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.760
nobody's really woken up to the fact

978
00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.839
that what lonely people don't get is

979
00:42:37.839 --> 00:42:40.160
touch

980
00:42:41.839 --> 00:42:44.839
hello

981
00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.359
video calls can give us a sense of

982
00:42:47.359 --> 00:42:49.760
closeness to family and friends

983
00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.440
but they cannot replace physical

984
00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.079
proximity

985
00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:59.130
many of us have now become aware of this

986
00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:04.030
[Laughter]

987
00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:09.760
before the pandemic

988
00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.160
commercials were full of happy people in

989
00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.839
front of tablets

990
00:43:13.839 --> 00:43:15.680
in front of cameras

991
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.359
waving to each other

992
00:43:17.359 --> 00:43:18.880
greeting their loved ones around the

993

994
00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.839
everyone was content and happy

995
00:43:23.839 --> 00:43:26.079
since the pandemic

996
00:43:26.079 --> 00:43:28.319
we've all had to rely on our digital

997
00:43:28.319 --> 00:43:29.440
devices

998
00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.839
peering into some little camera doing

999
00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:34.640
our best to balance our work while still

1000
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.440
keeping our social lives going

1001
00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.960
and the majority of us almost 90 percent

1002
00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.280
are incredibly unhappy with this type of

1003
00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.920
communication

1004
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.960
what would it be like if in the future

1005
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.400
we could also touch each other in the

1006
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.440
virtual world

1007
00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.680
until now our sense of touch has always

1008
00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.760
been considered too complex to be

1009
00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.040
technically replicated

1010
00:44:03.359 --> 00:44:05.680
touching over the internet

1011
00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.880
in this video it seems to work

1012
00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.520
a mother is touching the screen

1013
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.890
and her child feels her touch remotely

john rogers of northwestern university

1016
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.040
helped develop the system

1017
00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.560

[Music]

1020
00:44:27.599 --> 00:44:30.079
what we've tried to do is to develop

1021
00:44:30.079 --> 00:44:32.480
technologies that are compatible with

1022
00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:36.400
the human body soft flexible

1023
00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.520
skin interface platforms that you can

1024
00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.839
almost think of as a as like a second

1025
00:44:41.839 --> 00:44:42.960
skin

1026
00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.200
that can laminate onto different parts

1027
00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.800
of the body that might be of interest

1028
00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.400
they connect the artificial skin

1029
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.040
wirelessly to the computer

1030
00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.119
when the screen is touched the small

1031
00:44:55.119 --> 00:44:57.980
integrated electronic elements react

[Music]

1033
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.119
they convert the electrical currents

1034
00:45:03.119 --> 00:45:06.079
into pressure and vibrations

1035
00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:08.240
but the artificial skin cannot simulate

1036
00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.920
gentle touching

1037
00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.839
but it is a step in the right direction

1038
00:45:11.839 --> 00:45:14.000
that i think replicates the kind of

1039
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.160
touch that can serve as

1040
00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.640
you know a deeply sort of emotional and

1041
00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.000
personal

1042
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.319
uh you know connection with with other

1043
00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:25.119
other people so so we think about it uh

1044
00:45:25.119 --> 00:45:27.920
you know in terms of um you know adding

1045
00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.960
to the uh social media experience that

1046
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.960
that maybe we're engaging in right now

1047
00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.599
which is currently dominated only by

1048
00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:37.599
visual and auditory cues if you were

1049
00:45:37.599 --> 00:45:39.920
wearing a device i would be able to pat

1050
00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.520
your shoulder for example and you would

1051
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.599
be able to to feel that you know in in

1052
00:45:43.599 --> 00:45:44.839
real

1053
00:45:44.839 --> 00:45:48.400
time two of his employees show just how

1054
00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.800
noticeable these touches are

1055
00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.280
one draws letters on the screen

1056
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.440
his colleague can feel and reproduce

1057
00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.599
them on his arm

1058
00:45:57.599 --> 00:45:59.440
this artificial skin is not yet ready

1059
00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.800
for the market

1060
00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.319
but there are a number of potential

1061
00:46:02.319 --> 00:46:03.760
applications

1062
00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.040
video games

1063
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.440
feeling prosthesis and internet

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.160
communication

1065
00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.520
social media is one application that's

1066
00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.920
that's sort of obvious to think about i

1067
00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.240
think especially in the context of what

1068
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.839
we're living through right now with with

1069
00:46:19.839 --> 00:46:21.359
the pandemic and

1070
00:46:21.359 --> 00:46:24.560
sort of remote safe engagement uh that

1071
00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.920
still retains that um you know that that

1072
00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.480
that interaction based on touch and and

1073
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.319
it's really hard to replicate that and

1074
00:46:32.319 --> 00:46:34.079
you can't really replicate it just with

1075
00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:37.200
video and audio

1076
00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:40.400
touches sent online from a distance

1077
00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.160
could they provide a solution for those

1078
00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.560
in need of physical contact for example

1079
00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.800
for older people living alone or those

1080
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.240
in long distance relationships

1081
00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.280
at the very least it might be better

1082
00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.520
than no touching at all

1083
00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.119
but could this ever replace the feeling

1084
00:46:57.119 --> 00:46:59.040
we experienced during a face-to-face

1085
00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.599
encounter

1086
00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.440
you may be able to apply

1087
00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.760
a jacket and somebody can give you a

1088
00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.119
virtual hug which is quite a fun concept

1089
00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:13.280
however i still don't think it takes the

1090
00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.520
place of actual touch and the

1091
00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.640
reinforcement that you get from somebody

1092
00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:21.680
hugging you and both you enjoying it and

1093
00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.760
them they enjoy it as well when it's

1094
00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.520
hard of heart

1095
00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.920
when things get tough like during the

1096
00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:29.280
pandemic

1097
00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.599
it becomes clear that what we are truly

1098
00:47:31.599 --> 00:47:34.400
longing for isn't technology

1099
00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.800
we want a real person who goes out for a

1100
00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:40.960
beer with us or reads us poetry

[Music]

1102
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.319

effect

1104
00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.650

it's a basic component of our biological

makeup

1109
00:48:03.599 --> 00:48:05.839
we are all equipped with receptors for

gentle touch

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.119
differently

00:48:15.119 --> 00:48:18.000
experiences our cultural background how

1115

we perceive ourselves and our current

1117
00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.680
all this influences whether and when we

1118
00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.320
like it

1120
00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:33.440
but habit also shapes how we feel

1121
00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.680
our cuddle sensors need to be trained

1122
00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.880
regularly

1123
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.839
throughout our lives

1124
00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.880
people who are not touched

1125
00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.119
or do not want to be touched

1126
00:48:45.119 --> 00:48:47.599
find gentle caressing less pleasant over

1127
00:48:47.599 --> 00:48:48.790
time

1128
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:54.419
[Music]

1129
00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.400
and we think that

1130
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.800
if you get touched less and less in your

1131
00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.240
life

1132
00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:04.720
you miss it so much that you actually

1133
00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.640
you probably feel sad about it you may

1134
00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.880
become depressed about it

1135
00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:11.359
and that's not good because

1136
00:49:11.359 --> 00:49:13.599
you actually appreciate the touch less

1137
00:49:13.599 --> 00:49:16.000
and less and so you seek touch less and

1138
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:16.960
less

1139
00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.040
so really for touch you have to have

1140
00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.400
touch on a

1141
00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.839
on a

1142
00:49:21.839 --> 00:49:24.240
on a basis which is very regular

1143
00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.720
otherwise we tend to lose these these

1144
00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:29.440
signals these interactions and

1145
00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.079
it takes effort to to reinforce them

1146
00:49:32.079 --> 00:49:33.540

even into old age

1152
00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.520
a caress can still reach a person even

1153
00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:51.119
when they are barely connected to the

1154
00:49:51.119 --> 00:49:53.839
physical world

1155
00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:57.440
it conveys emotions that we so urgently

1156
00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:01.119
need especially towards the end of life

1157
00:50:01.119 --> 00:50:02.800
reliability

1158

1161
00:50:10.319 --> 00:50:12.640
rochelle ackerly has made a remarkable

1162
00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.200
discovery

1163
00:50:15.359 --> 00:50:17.520
the case of touch is very interesting

1164
00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:18.880
because

1165
00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.280
it's true that for the other senses

1166
00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.079
they

1167
00:50:22.079 --> 00:50:23.200
diminish

1168
00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:26.400
with time and so as we get older you see

1169
00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:28.960
less well you hear less well

1170
00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.599
however for touch it seems to have two

1171
00:50:31.599 --> 00:50:32.640
layers

1172
00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:36.480
so the touch that you have which is what

1173
00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.559
we call discriminative touch it's the

1174
00:50:38.559 --> 00:50:40.559
touch for example when you reach out and

1175
00:50:40.559 --> 00:50:42.800
touch something with your hands

1176
00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.760
that does decrease with age so

1177
00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:46.640
um

1178
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.000
it's every

1179
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.160
for example every ten years or so in

1180
00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.400
your life you will lose about five

1181
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.040
percent of all the touch fibers in your

1182
00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.079
nerves

1183
00:50:56.079 --> 00:50:58.640
however what we find is that when people

1184
00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.160
get older

1185
00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.319
they appreciate touch more and they

1186
00:51:02.319 --> 00:51:06.360
actually find touch more pleasurable

1188
00:51:10.319 --> 00:51:12.800
we often don't realize how strongly

1189
00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.760
touch affects our mood our health

1190
00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:18.880
and our relationships

1191
00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.400
but we are becoming more and more aware

1192
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.559
of it

1193
00:51:24.559 --> 00:51:26.559
touch makes us happy

1194
00:51:26.559 --> 00:51:30.359
throughout our lives
