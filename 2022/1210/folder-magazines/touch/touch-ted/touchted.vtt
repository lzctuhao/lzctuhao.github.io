[Music]

2
00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.600
ah

3
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.840
great

4
00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.760
wow breathing

5
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.680
and touching whoever would have thought

6
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.040
these things

7
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.640
would have become fraught with anxiety

8
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.520
for so many people would have been

9
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.559
subject

10
00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.239
to rules and regulations

11
00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.039
ah breathing and touching

12
00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.600
so fundamental for all of us human

13
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.280
beings

14
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.400
and so important at this point of time

15
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.600
to be aware of how we breathe and who we

16
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.360
touch

17
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.320
so many social restrictions stay two

18
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.840
meters away

19
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.280
wash your hands wear a mask

20
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.159
all of these things are important to

21
00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.360
protect ourselves

22
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.280
and other people at this time of

23
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.840
pandemic

24
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.119
many people are suffering and dealing

25
00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:31.920
with

26
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.680
symptoms of the covet virus

27
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.479
and suffering physically but there are

28
00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.960
so many people who are suffering

29
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.880
emotionally because of this virus

30
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.040
people dealing with isolation anxiety

31
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.079
depression even suicidal thoughts

32
00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.680
so difficult for so many people

33
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.799
and i've spoken to countless people

34
00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.600
over these last months and so many

35
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.360
people report

36
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.280
feeling just not good in their skin

37
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.800
and when i really asked what it was

38
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.920
people were experiencing tactile

39
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.000
deprivation what do i mean

40
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.520
by tactile deprivation

41
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.280
touch tactile deprivation

42
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.280
lack of and touch is something that we

43
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.480
all need for healthy

44
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.519
function and to really thrive

45
00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.879
in the world as human beings so many

46
00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.480
people are cocooning

47
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.519
and isolating and shielding

48
00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.640
and lacking touch and we took

49
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.920
touch for granted hugs

50
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.239
cuddles high fives handshakes

51
00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.519
and now there's this absence of touch

52
00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.560
and we really miss it

53
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.519
and it's like our skin is hungry for

54
00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.640
touch

55
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.000
and i'm not talking about sexual touch

56
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.440
i'm talking about non-sexual physical

57
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.599
contact

58
00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.879
and we all need that to survive

59
00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:25.120
so skin hunger tactile deprivation

60
00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.720
when were you last touched when were you

61
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.200
last

62
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.480
hugged when will you be next

63
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.920
touched or next hugged

64
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.120
how did it feel did it bring up

65
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.120
a kind of a longing and a relief or did

66
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.200
it make you feel sad

67
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.480
was it something you really missed

68
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.920
touch is always emotional

69
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.319
and we all need good physical touch

70
00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.760
we've all seen images of romanian babies

71
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.599
who lack touch they

72
00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.720
survived but they didn't thrive and to

73
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.040
really thrive as a human being

74
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.840
we need contact and you think of that

75
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.319
word

76
00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.439
con and tact with touch

77
00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.920
we're apes we like to touch each other

78
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.120
to groom

79
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.720
it's part of our social function

80
00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.639
it determines who we are and when we

81
00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.240
don't have touch

82
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.600
we miss it and so many people

83
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.800
are missing touch right now now i don't

84
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.160
take it for granted

85
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.320
the touch is a positive experience for

86
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.840
everybody

87
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.120
if you've had good bonding as a child

88
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.759
then touch is something you really enjoy

89
00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:44.800
and you can relax

90
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.080
into it and you can trust it

91
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.040
but if touch has been something fraught

92
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.240
with

93
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.120
difficulty abuse maybe there hasn't been

94
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.800
appropriate touch

95
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.280
it's not something that you will relax

96
00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.840
into

97
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.960
something you'll avoid but for most

98
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.080
people touch is an essential part of

99
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.479
being

100
00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.639
human now you may ask why does this

101
00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.400
interest me

102
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.120
this whole area of touch has been

103
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.199
fundamental to my work for the last

104
00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.240
40 years or so i trained as a

105
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.880
psychotherapist and a massage therapist

106
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.000
and a bodywork therapist and i

107
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.759
understand the connection between the

108
00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:30.960
mind and the body

109
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.000
i have always been more interested in

110
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.720
the psychological application of touch

111
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.720
more really than just the manipulation

112
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.360
of muscles

113
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.240
many years ago i was invited

114
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.000
to give a lecture in sweden

115
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.160
at the first conference on death and

116
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.919
dying

117
00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.639
the reason i was invited was because i

118
00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:57.039
had

119
00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.160
taught massage to nurses

120
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.600
at the michael sobel hospice i'd been

121
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.600
many times president of the irish

122
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.080
massage

123
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.360
therapists association and i was asked

124
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.000
to teach the nurses

125
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.080
and i could see what they were doing had

126
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.400
beneficial effects

127
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.160
they were working with their patients

128
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.479
who were terminally ill and they

129
00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:24.000
found that anxiety was decreased

130
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.160
when massage was introduced as part of a

131
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.759
care plan

132
00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:30.400
people slept better pain seemed to

133
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.120
diminish

134
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.400
and so on and i knew these things

135
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.560
from what i could see and from what

136
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.639
people were reporting back

137
00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:41.280
but when i was asked to give this talk i

138
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.720
was much younger

139
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.600
more insecure and i decided well i

140
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.080
needed

141
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.319
facts and research to substantiate and

142
00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.000
back up what i knew to be true

143
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.919
intuitively

144
00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:55.440
so i spent two days in a medical library

145
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.639
in london

146
00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:00.479
trolling through journals and magazines

147
00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:03.520
and so on looking for research

148
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.639
about the importance and the benefits of

149
00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:08.720
human touch

150
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.639
believe me this was the time before the

151
00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:11.759
internet

152
00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:14.720
there was nothing there there were

153
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.000
research papers

154
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.680
on monkeys who gravitated

155
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.240
towards terry cloth monkeys rather than

156
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.840
barbed wire monkeys

157
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.280
but nothing about human touch

158
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.840
so i gave my lecture

159
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.319
and i gave it on the basis of what i

160
00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:35.280
knew

161
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.360
and i felt was right and since then

162
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.520
there has been so much research in the

163
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.199
last 40 years

164
00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:47.360
on touch if you have a body

165
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.919
touch is beneficial from the cradle to

166
00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:51.360
the grave

167
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.400
touch with pre-term infants touch with

168
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.199
toddlers

169
00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:57.599
touch with adolescents touch with the

170
00:07:57.599 --> 00:07:58.800
bereaved

171
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.319
touch in palliative care it's part

172
00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:05.840
and fundamental part of being human

173
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.960
i'm also a funeral celebrant and i have

174
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.599
seen

175
00:08:09.599 --> 00:08:12.879
first hand how people have been been

176
00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:14.000
impacted

177
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.240
by this lack of touch at this particular

178
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.160
time

179
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.160
touch it says more than a thousand words

180
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.199
it's soothing it connects it gives you

181
00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:26.560
support

182
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.599
it helps us get through difficult times

183
00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:33.039
and many people have complicated grief

184
00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.599
and bereavement issues because of this

185
00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:38.839
lack of human connection and human

186
00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:41.839
contact

187
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.920
as human beings i believe that love

188
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.200
is one of our greatest

189
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.040
greatest greatest things that we can

190
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.240
express and we can express that through

191
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.640
our hands

192
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.279
if you think of our capacity to love and

193
00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:00.880
how we express

194
00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.839
i believe that our hands grow directly

195
00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:05.680
out of our hearts

196
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.640
and our hands are a vehicle to connect

197
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.120
up

198
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.080
with other people

199
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.120
i'd like you to look at a slide or two

200
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.839
slides that i have here

201
00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:20.680
they're interesting slides and what they

202
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.920
represent

203
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.480
is a proportional representation

204
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.240
of the human body and a cross-section

205
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.839
of the cerebral cortex one showing motor

206
00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:34.640
function

207
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.080
and one showing sensory function

208
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.320
and if you look at it the parts of the

209
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.720
brain related to the hand

210
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.560
there's a lot of motor function in the

211
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.959
hand it's very complicated

212
00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:49.279
and if you look at the parts the brain

213
00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:50.000
related to

214
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.040
sensation and the hand you'll see how

215
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.920
sensitive

216
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.279
the hand is the hand

217
00:09:57.279 --> 00:10:00.800
feels so much the hand

218
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.839
feels all kinds of textures and the hand

219
00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:04.560
not only

220
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.959
feels but also feels emotionally

221
00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:13.519
touch is so important in our lives

222
00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:17.680
and at this time we need to feel

223
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.360
connected

224
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.240
and we need to understand the benefits

225
00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.079
of human touch

226
00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:27.839
and how that can help us and we think of

227
00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:30.560
the benefits

228
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.839
tactile stimulation of the skin somebody

229
00:10:33.839 --> 00:10:36.000
once referred to the skin as a sort of

230
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.720
second brain it relates to the

231
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.600
immune system it relates to the

232
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.880
digestive system

233
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.880
it relates to all the systems in the

234
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.519
human body

235
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.600
there are so many sensory receptors

236
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.839
in the skin and when they're stimulated

237
00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:02.079
anxiety decreases

238
00:11:02.079 --> 00:11:04.320
when we're anxious when we're lonely

239
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.600
when we're depressed

240
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.880
we have a lot of cortisol in our systems

241
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.800
that makes us feel anxious and tense

242
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.760
but when we're relaxed and the skin

243
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.399
is stimulated all kinds of other

244
00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:26.160
hormones are released oxytocin

245
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.200
dopamine and these things

246
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.279
increase your sense of well-being

247
00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:36.320
isn't that amazing that stimulation of

248
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.440
the skin

249
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.000
has such a deep effect on so many

250
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.839
systems of the body

251
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.079
so what can we do about that if we're in

252
00:11:48.079 --> 00:11:49.920
relationships

253
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.720
well and good we can have our partners

254
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.560
or our families

255
00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.839
working with us to soothe and to cuddle

256
00:11:57.839 --> 00:12:01.120
and comfort and to hug

257
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.040
but so many people are living on their

258
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.279
own

259
00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:08.720
so what can what can they do

260
00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.519
to support themselves and self-nourish

261
00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:13.040
and care and comfort

262
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.959
at this time well there's lots that can

263
00:12:16.959 --> 00:12:19.360
be done

264
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.800
we can intentionally soothe our skins

265
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.160
it doesn't matter if you're doing it

266
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.880
through clothes or skin to skin

267
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.639
but gentle stroking can make you feel

268
00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:36.959
comforted and that has a deep response

269
00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:41.360
on as i said all the systems of body

270
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.720
soothing caring massaging

271
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.279
holding

272
00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:51.760
if you have partners or if you have

273
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.880
children

274
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.519
sit on the couch hug them back rubs

275
00:12:57.519 --> 00:13:00.959
if you're on your own and you have a pet

276
00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:03.360
the interesting thing about touch is the

277
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.519
benefits are mutual

278
00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:08.000
if you stroke your pet he or she will

279
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.200
respond

280
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.600
and so will you it will be a beneficial

281
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.320
experience

282
00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:18.959
stimulate your skin with showers with

283
00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:20.720
the wind

284
00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.680
cuddle yourself in a blanket and just

285
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.279
know that all these things are having a

286
00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:26.639
beneficial effect

287
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.600
on your whole body

288
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.200
so let's hope that when this pandemic is

289
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.560
over

290
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.480
and we can get back out there and we can

291
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.920
hug our friends and comfort and cuddle

292
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.440
and reach out that we will all remember

293
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.360
the importance of skin contact

294
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.320
and the fact that your hands really are

295
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.079
rooted in your heart

296
00:13:54.079 --> 00:13:56.560
and they are a vehicle for expressing

297
00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:02.300
love into our world

298
00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:14.880
