00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.759
the greatest gift we can give anyone

2
00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:09.760
is not jewelry

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.759
or flowers

4
00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.880
or a new macbook pro

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.680
it is to simply give

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.000
our attention to someone

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.439

attention

11
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.279
this is to allow someone else

12
00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.199
to become a part of you

13
00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.399
to allow

14
00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.840
their space

15
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.239

16
00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.559
without judgment

17
00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.160

21
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.120
in a world of

attention deficit

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.120
it's even more valuable to just be with

someone

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.320
you don't have to say

27
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.799
the right thing

28
00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.260

it's simply that warm hug

acting out

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.200

this is what happens

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.879
when we sit with someone

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.799
we are taking them in

which anyone can do

115
00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.080
where you sit with someone else

116
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.199
and you just stare into their eyes

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.639
for an extended period of time

118
00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.280
at first it feels awkward and weird and

119
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.520
you want to look away

120
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.000
and as you break through this

121
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.720
there is a great sense

122
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.240
of the two becoming one

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.800

in ways that

133
00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.120
sometimes meditating alone can never do

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.800

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.320
just as

139
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.240
when we normally think

140
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.440
we think one word at a time

141
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.600
and when we speak we speak one word at a

142
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.199
time

143
00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.880
but this form of

144
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.840
communication or self-communication

145
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.919
is very limited

146
00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.759
one word at a time is not a lot of

147
00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.680
information

148
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.680
but when we feel

149
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.440
when we sense

150
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.600
we can take in

151
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.639
thousands and millions of

152
00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.400

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.240
all at once

154
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.400
and we can tune into this

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.759
understanding

156
00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.280
this deeper

wisdom

158
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.199
and we can share this

159
00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.199
with another person

160
00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:17.280
and we can truly commune with their soul

161
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.600
and truly get an essence of their being

162
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.240
far more effectively

163
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.080
than our normal mode of communication

164
00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.840

afraid to sit with someone

do not be afraid of silence
