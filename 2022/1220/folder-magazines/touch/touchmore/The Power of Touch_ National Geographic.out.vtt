因为我们有
because we have research from dr

史蒂文森博士和加里施瓦茨博士的研究，他们说

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.160
从你出生的那一刻起，触觉就很重要，

他们说袋鼠触觉，他们说，呃，

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.360
在出生后几乎连续进行时会更有效
continuous and starts after birth that

60
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.160
他们在这篇文章中说触摸是
they say in this article that touch is

61

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.639
抱着
held

66
00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.520
和触摸 肯尼斯史蒂文森博士告诉我们

67
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.919
它发生的重要性是
is the important it happens is the last

68
00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.600
我们死后的最后感觉她

对补充或
nothing about complementary or

81
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.479
替代一无所知，这就是她发现的

82
00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.120
是的 除了博士，她还有一位医学

83
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.880
博士，一位医学博士，我的意思是
doctor a medical doctor i mean which

84
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.759
他们认为这比博士更高，
they believe is higher than phd but

85
00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.120
但当然
of course

86
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.000
可以，所以生物技术所以如果你注意到
okay so so biotech so if you notice the

87
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.360
那里的黄色，那么 biotouch 与
yellow there so biotouch is related with

88
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.280
所有事情有关，比如定心、
all the things as far as centering or

孩子没有任何关系

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.360
，而 biotouch 则没有，她将它
with biotouch and she related it to some

97
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.720
与其他一些技术联系起来 在那里

触摸并不是所有这些

127
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.319
它的时间，现在就是

129
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.639
，biotouch 已经为这个做好了准备
and biotouch is all set up for this well

130
00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:18.479
让我分享更多关于这项
and let me share a little more about the

131
00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.720
研究的信息 加里在这里发现我们总是
research that gary found here we always

132
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.759
谈论
talk about

133
00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:24.319
他的派对谈论爱情，但他
his the party talks about love but he

134
00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:26.880
说，呃，
said uh that

135
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.199
他
that the data he did this

136
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.599
和一群新生
research with a bunch of freshman

137
00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:34.479
心理学学生一起做这项研究的数据，他说数据
psychology students and he said the data

138
00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:37.720
清楚地表明，虽然
clearly showed that whereas

139
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.280
没有联系
non-contact

140
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.000
我们，
us

141
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.599
但他做了治疗工作
he did healing work with people

142
00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:44.720
非接触的人的影响很小 布
non-contact had a minimal effect cloth

143
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.479
接触你穿过衣服触摸的地方
contact where you touched through the

144
00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:49.599
有中等影响
clothing had a moderate effect it was

145
00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:52.000
直接皮肤接触
direct skin contact that showed the

146
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.199
在减少手术后报告的疼痛方面显示出最大的效果
greatest effect in terms of reducing

147
00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:57.199
reported pain

148
00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:59.199
following a procedure

149
00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:01.280
哇，这些差异在统计上非常
wow these differences were highly

150
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.319
显着，一句话
statistically significant in a word

151
00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:06.240
直接 身体接触很
direct physical touch

152
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.000
重要，
matter

153
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.400
所以他问的问题是，
so the question he asks is why

154
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.319
为什么主要物理的原因是
well is the reason primary phys

155
00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:15.440
生理的还是心理的，
physiological or is it psychological or

156
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.800
或者可能是
is it possibly electromagnetic effects

157
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.120
与直接身体接触或操作相关的电磁效应
associated with direct physical contact

158
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.280
or operating

159
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.680
，以及他的假设和他实际上
and what his hypothesis and he actually

160
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.520
进入它的莫琳称之为治疗
goes into it maureen called the healing

161
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.240
实验呃 他的假设是这
experiments uh his hypothesis is that

162
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.320
三者可能都参与
all three are probably involved in the

00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:38.000
只是因为
only because

323
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.560
我别无选择它就在这里我知道不我们
i got no choice it's here i know no we

324
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.880
最好都习惯它所以
better all get used to it and so

325
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.959
它可能是不同的
it might be a different generation that

326
00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:46.959
一代 将成为他们生活的一部分，但我想
it'll be part of their life but i want

327
00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:49.920
成为将触摸带入其中的建筑的一部分
to be part of the building of bringing

328
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.399
，因此如果他们
touch into that and so if they're

329
00:14:52.399 --> 00:14:55.519
发现不仅假肢
finding not only that a prosthetic can

330
00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:58.000
现在可以为那个人的感觉创造信息，
now create messages to that person

331
00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.680
sensation

332
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.839
他们也在创造这些手套我
they're also creating these gloves i i

333
00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:04.000
实际上 在广告中看到
actually saw in the commercial where

334
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.680
他们有这种拥抱的
they have this hug

335
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.920
东西，所以你和某人一起放大，
thing and so you zoom with somebody and

336
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.839
然后穿上这件衬衫是的，两个
you put on this shirt yes the two

337
00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:12.800
兄弟，两个不同的国家

哦，天哪，这太棒了，是的
oh my gosh that is amazing yeah right

339
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.920
，所以如果他们在大脑
and so if they're finding in the brain

340
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.959
中找到触发的东西 你知道，然后
what that's triggering you know then

341
00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:24.160
biotouch 将自己定位
biotouch is positioning itself to be

342
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.440
为这项运动的一部分哦，是的，为什么
part of this movement oh yes well why

343
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.399
不在这里它现在就在这里它
not it's here it's here for now it is

344
00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:32.399
it's part of the unfolding of what's

345
00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:36.399
是我们所谓的健康社区中即将发生
coming for us in in the community of

346
00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:37.920
what we call

347
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.120
health

348
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.240
的事情的一部分，它将发挥作用 阿胡 ge part 我
and it's going to play a huge part i

349
00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.320
毫不怀疑，因为如果国家
have no doubt because if national

350
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.240
地理是正确的，那么触摸的力量
geographic is right the power of touch

351
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.120
then

352
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.079
就会到来，是的，它就在这里，所以对于
it's coming yes it's here so for all of

353
00:15:52.079 --> 00:15:54.639
我们所有人来说，仍然有人伸出手去

354
00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:55.600
触摸
touch

355
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.440
我们在大流行期间所说的是，如果
what we said during the pandemic is if

356
00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.440
你没有人
you don't have someone

357
00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.240
做 这些要点，但想想
do the points but think of somebody

358
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.240
有人对你这样做，我们必须保持良好的
doing it to you we've got to keep the

359
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.480
关系，如果这种
relationship going right and if that

360
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.880
关系是因为我们
relationship is because we're thousands

361
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.759
相距数千英里，而我们所拥有的只是
of miles away and all we have are these

362
00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:14.560
这些缩放会议，但我们现在可以
these zoom meetings but we now can

363
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.399
创造这样一种感觉 我们会走到
create the sense that we're coming

364
00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:17.440
一起
together

365
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.199
，很快我们就会发现它是否

366
00:16:19.199 --> 00:16:21.680
真的只是一个全息图如果

在 20 年代和 40 年代，这个星球上有些人实际上
back in the 20s and 40s who actually

372
00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:33.759
可以
could

373
00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:36.000

doing bio touch with you

386
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.120
在你的身体上与你进行生物接触，然后你这样做，
on your body and then you do it
