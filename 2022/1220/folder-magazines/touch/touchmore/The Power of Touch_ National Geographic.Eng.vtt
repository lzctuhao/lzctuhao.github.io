awesome yes because we are dealing with

26
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.800
the national geographic cover

27
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.159
called the power of touch

28
00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.440
oh my god i know oh my god where do we

29
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.959
even start

30
00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:15.760
oh

31
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.239
well we start with that little i don't

32
00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.080
know if you can see it there it says

33
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.800
research repeat reveals

34
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.640
how our connections with others keep us

35
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.040
healthy

36
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.080
and there's pages upon pages upon pages

37
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.680
about how important touch is to health

38
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.239
and humanity humanity don't you love

39
00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.120
that

40
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.720
what have we been talking about for

41
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.720
years continuously is connected

42
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.599
humanity oh my gosh so we wanted to

43
00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.680
share this article

44
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.680
and first of all those few key words

45
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.599
there that are really important uh

46
00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.760
because we have research from dr

47
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.720
stevenson and dr gary schwartz that say

48
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.439
the same thing same thing yes

49
00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.080
so how important this touch is

50
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.159
let's start with that you know as they

51
00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.560
go on to later we'll talk about that it

52
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.720
goes into how they're creating touch for

53
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.720
prosthetics and things like that that's

54
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.840
amazing because touch is important from

55
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.160
the time you're born

56
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.839
they say kangaroo touch they say uh the

57
00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.639
who in africa found that kangaroo care

58
00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.560
is even more effective when it's nearly

59
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.360
continuous and starts after birth that

60
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.160
they say in this article that touch is

61
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.400
the first sense when we come into this

62
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.440
yes absolutely right i mean

63
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.880
think about it

64
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.360
the moment you're born yes you're being

65
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.639
held

66
00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.520
and touch dr kenneth stevenson told us

67
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.919
is the important it happens is the last

68
00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.600
sense we have when we die she worked

69
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.680
with death and dying patients

70
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.639
so

71
00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.360
how important from birth to death at

72
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.840
what they call kangaroo touch so let's

73
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.320
share how can a dr kenneth stevenson

74
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.639
show that i know

75
00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:03.360
and

76
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.160
we got to say this was a totally

77
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.240
allopathically trained

78
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.000
phd doctor in doing research for

79
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.400
pharmaceutical companies i mean she knew

80
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.720
nothing about complementary or

81
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.479
alternative and this is what she found

82
00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.120
yeah beyond phd she had an md medical

83
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.880
doctor a medical doctor i mean which

84
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.759
they believe is higher than phd but

85
00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.120
of course

86
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.000
okay so so biotech so if you notice the

87
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.360
yellow there so biotouch is related with

88
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.280
all the things as far as centering or

89
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.680
meditation or reading or unruffling a

90
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.240
skin-to-skin contact always with

91
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.520
biotouch and always with kangaroo touch

92
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.840
no levels no hierarchy there's none of

93
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.000
that with kangaroo touch with a mother

94
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.520
touching a child

95
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.880
and there's none with

96
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.360
with biotouch and she related it to some

97
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.720
of the other techniques out there that

98
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.800
she researched online reiki therapeutic

99
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.880
touch not that nothing that all these

100
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.199
things are effective but the importance

101
00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:03.600
of touch is what we're trying to show

102
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.960
here right and not off the body right

103
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.680
right right oh that that can when you

104
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.800
think about the the kangaroo touch

105
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.440
what happens if if your child

106
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.840
is hurting the fur they don't even think

107
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.800
about it

108
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.919
it's so innate in us that nurturing i

109
00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.560
don't care if you are male or female

110
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.600
it's all within all of us that ability

111
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.960
to care for for compassion and to just

112
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.919
want to

113
00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.160
help some something mother picks up that

114
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.120
baby instantly and starts to soothe it

115
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.240
and holds it right so yeah it's it's in

116
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.280
all of us already it's who we are

117
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.759
which is the beauty of biotouch biotouch

118
00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:49.280
meets us with who we are in the present

119
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.240
moment you don't have to go get it you

120
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.479
don't have to develop it right you don't

121
00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.680
have to be initiated into it the fact

122
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.160
that you were born

123
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.039
you're a citizen of the planet yes

124
00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:07.199
and you can help humanity heal and if

125
00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:09.680
there's ever a time on the planet when

126
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.960
it's needed

127
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.319
it's now

128
00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:13.440
now

129
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.639
and biotouch is all set up for this well

130
00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:18.479
and let me share a little more about the

131
00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.720
research that gary found here we always

132
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.759
talk about

133
00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:24.319
his the party talks about love but he

134
00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:26.880
said uh that

135
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.199
that the data he did this

136
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.599
research with a bunch of freshman

137
00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:34.479
psychology students and he said the data

138
00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:37.720
clearly showed that whereas

139
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.280
non-contact

140
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.000
us

141
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.599
he did healing work with people

142
00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:44.720
non-contact had a minimal effect cloth

143
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.479
contact where you touched through the

144
00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:49.599
clothing had a moderate effect it was

145
00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:52.000
direct skin contact that showed the

146
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.199
greatest effect in terms of reducing

147
00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:57.199
reported pain

148
00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:59.199
following a procedure

149
00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:01.280
wow these differences were highly

150
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.319
statistically significant in a word

151
00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:06.240
direct physical touch

152
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.000
matter

153
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.400
so the question he asks is why

154
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.319
well is the reason primary phys

155
00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:15.440
physiological or is it psychological or

156
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.800
is it possibly electromagnetic effects

157
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.120
associated with direct physical contact

158
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.280
or operating

159
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.680
and what his hypothesis and he actually

160
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.520
goes into it maureen called the healing

161
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.240
experiments uh his hypothesis is that

162
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.320
all three are probably involved in the

163
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.479
process of biotouch physiological

164
00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:36.479
psychological well we say it's a

165
00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:39.360
holistic technique right yes all of the

166
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.799
above

167
00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.479
but he said the second lesson is

168
00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:44.080
somewhat deeper and frankly more

169
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.320
inspiring the kind of love that biotouch

170
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.240
fosters is a high level of love

171
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.360
including empathy compassion caring

172
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.839
gentleness protection safety warmth

173
00:08:53.839 --> 00:08:56.080
gratitude and appreciation as you

174
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.240
explore deborah's gracious and grateful

175
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.720
book my wish is that you become filled

176
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.880
as i did with the wonder and promise

177
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.760
that biotouch offers all of us our loved

178
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.959
ones the greater humanity and nature

179
00:09:08.959 --> 00:09:11.120
itself wow

180
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.600
oh my gosh

181
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.279
there it is here it is

182
00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:18.160
now it's on national geographic yes

183
00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.839
but here's the thing that we've been

184
00:09:19.839 --> 00:09:20.720
saying

185
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.480
you don't have to go find it because

186
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.320
we've been here

187
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.399
you established this 30-something years

188
00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:29.360
ago we have this great foundation that's

189
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.760
holding this for everybody

190
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.640
trying to get the word out for you

191
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.880

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.760
of people there and they had me talk

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.279
everybody's yacking away and i get up

233
00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:13.680
there and i and i say all right i want

234
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.760
everybody to take two fingers and i want

235
00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.160
you to reach over and touch somebody

236
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.800
next to you

237
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.360
silence moment of silence i know you

238
00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.120
didn't have to do anything even people

239
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.120
that were watching it said oh my god

240
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.959
that was so powerful that for that

241
00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:30.320
moment that they reached over and

242
00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.240
touched someone on the face on the

243
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.480
shoulder on the arm there was a moment

244
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.920
of silence the connection had been made

245
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.200
through touch

246
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.560
you know you know what's interesting

247
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.600
about that is that touch what happens

248
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.399
when we touch it's almost like the body

249
00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:50.240
takes a breath and says oh

250
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.760
this is life

251
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.680
biotouch is about this rhythm of life

252
00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.480
that is runs through all of us and when

253
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.440
we practice biotouch we are

254
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.040
like connecting to that essence of all

255
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.040
of life as gary says

256
00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.399
nature we are part of nature on this

257
00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:11.920
planet

258
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.320
we can understand that come on

259
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.160
let's let's be one with nature

260
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.800
you know we are human beings we can now

261
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.519
be in the presence with another human

262
00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:25.040
through touch

263
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.040
more of the article here which is very

264
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.880
interesting so they spend a lot of time

265
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.120
going into the power of touch and what

266
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.519
it does in the brain and the connections

267
00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:35.920
so what they've created now

268
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.600
is they're creating prosthetics

269
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.200
especially for people that don't have

270
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.279
arms or hands

271
00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:44.639
and they're creating the ability that

272
00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:46.560
in the fingertips that you put it with

273
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.120
the prosthetic is creating messages that

274
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.880
go to those parts of the brain that they

275
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.920
found that relate to touch

276
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.880
okay

277
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.200
and the the discussion they have with

278
00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.360
people who have tried it is they feel

279
00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.800
whole

280
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.760
they feel connected again

281
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.160
yeah because there's this power in the

282
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.040
hands that they're finding out the power

283
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.079
of touch the fingers the hands

284
00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:14.800
creates something in the brain

285
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.880
that helps us understand that we're part

286
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.880
of humanity you know we've mentioned

287
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.480
this before and actually

288
00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.200
shown some pictures in other shows but

289
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.920
if you will look at some of the ancient

290
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.480
pictures some of the older art you know

291
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.959
the the uh artists and the the

292
00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:34.079
sculptures and and people from the you

293
00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:34.959
know

294
00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:38.000
long ago periods you will see

295
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.880
that

296
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.240
they paint

297
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.839
pictures of angels and great teachers

298
00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:46.000
and great

299
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.079
doing this

300
00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:51.680
you know either reaching out or saying

301
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.760
here i am or whatever this is always

302
00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.800
been

303
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.680
this is a message for us that is back

304
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.399
now it's time i wonder if i have that

305
00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:04.560
photos here oh i know it's beautiful

306
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.560
well there's people there's actual

307
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.839
people

308
00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:10.399
but yes and um

309
00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:12.000
but yeah some of these pictures and

310
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.480
sculptures that we have seen oh

311
00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.399
it's been around a while

312
00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:18.800
so here's something very interesting

313
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.720
that excites me a lot you know people

314
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.680
are like

315
00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.440
we always get the question well i don't

316
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.920
have anybody here you know or i'm locked

317
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.240
down i don't have anybody to talk to i'm

318
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.639
just doing the zoom you know oh the

319
00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:32.720
metaverse you know that's just you know

320
00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.320
i don't want to deal with it but i get

321
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.639
really excited about all this technology

322
00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:38.000
only because

323
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.560
i got no choice it's here i know no we

324
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.880
better all get used to it and so

325
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.959
it might be a different generation that

326
00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:46.959
it'll be part of their life but i want

327
00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:49.920
to be part of the building of bringing

328
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.399
touch into that and so if they're

329
00:14:52.399 --> 00:14:55.519
finding not only that a prosthetic can

330
00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:58.000
now create messages to that person

331
00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.680
sensation

332
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.839
they're also creating these gloves i i

333
00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:04.000
actually saw in the commercial where

334
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.680
they have this hug

335
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.920
thing and so you zoom with somebody and

336
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.839
you put on this shirt yes the two

337
00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:12.800
brothers two different countries

338
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.680
oh my gosh that is amazing yeah right

339
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.920
and so if they're finding in the brain

340
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.959
what that's triggering you know then

341
00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:24.160
biotouch is positioning itself to be

342
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.440
part of this movement oh yes well why

343
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.399
not it's here it's here for now it is

344
00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:32.399
it's part of the unfolding of what's

345
00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:36.399
coming for us in in the community of

346
00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:37.920
what we call

347
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.120
health

348
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.240
and it's going to play a huge part i

349
00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.320
have no doubt because if national

350
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.240
geographic is right the power of touch

351
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.120
then

352
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.079
it's coming yes it's here so for all of

353
00:15:52.079 --> 00:15:54.639
us who still have someone reach out and

354
00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:55.600
touch

355
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.440
what we said during the pandemic is if

356
00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.440
you don't have someone

357
00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.240
do the points but think of somebody

358
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.240
doing it to you we've got to keep the

359
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.480
relationship going right and if that

360
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.880
relationship is because we're thousands

361
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.759
of miles away and all we have are these

362
00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:14.560
these zoom meetings but we now can

363
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.399
create the sense that we're coming

364
00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:17.440
together

365
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.199
and pretty soon we'll find out if it's

366
00:16:19.199 --> 00:16:21.680
just really a hologram to begin with if

367
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.759
you believe in the matrix all i have to

368
00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:25.839
do is blink my eyes and i could be

369
00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:27.839
worried not to take that pill yeah i

370
00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:30.399
mean there were people on this planet

371
00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:32.639
back in the 20s and 40s who actually

372
00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:33.759
could

373
00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:36.000
take their body and move it to another

374
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.560
place and meet somebody absolutely casey

375
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.920
swedenborg

376
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.519
all of these amazing

377
00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:42.560
so

378
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.320
you're talking about

379
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.320
the true con we talk about the

380
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.800
connection between us

381
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.800
time space

382
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.079
distance cannot break the connection

383
00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:55.920
between two people

384
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.560
so if you are thinking about that person

385
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.880
doing bio touch with you

386
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.120
on your body and then you do it

387
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.599
it is it's real

388
00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:08.400
it's a connection yes yeah and so if

389
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.559
we're if we're then triggering

390
00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:12.559
senses in our in our brain that

391
00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:14.720
recognizes it as touch

392
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.039
well then it becomes easy you know i can

393
00:17:17.039 --> 00:17:19.520
easily reach out through this screen

394
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.480
touch that two points of the greeting

395
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.400
and healing will begin to happen and

396
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.559
you'll sense that i'm touching you i

397
00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:28.799
mean we do all of our board meetings we

398
00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:32.000
started doing the greeting we did a a

399
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.840
we break up into rooms and we actually

400
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.720
touch one another through the screen

401
00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.600
crazy ass but

402
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.280
it seems to work so so i'm excited you

403
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.600
know that we're we're sort of again in

404
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.520
the cutting edge i remember doing the

405
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.080
first website when you only had a page

406
00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.039
we were there i know and here it is 35

407
00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:55.280
years later and we're still we have been

408
00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.240
told by some really big guns that we

409
00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.960
have brought in like guys you already

410
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.400
ahead of the game right so something is

411
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.080
going on with biotouch because it we're

412
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.600
the custodians it has to be kept

413
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.400
sacred and the integrity held

414
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.440
and the truth of it the the the love

415
00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.320
part of it has to continue that's our

416
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.200
job

417
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.240
for you

418
00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.760

419
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.559
everybody in the world to be able to use

420
00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:28.720

422
00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.600
two fingers of your dominant hand

all right

424
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.400
touch

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.919
feel it on yourself you've got somebody

426
00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:39.760
next to you that much better feel that

427
00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.760
breast bone right in the center of your

428
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.039
chest there

429
00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:45.120
follow it down follow it down and all of

430
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.919
a sudden drops off into some soft tissue

431
00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:49.760
some people say it's softer than others

432
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.400
but you know whatever you want yeah yeah

433
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.120
hold there six to eight seconds

434
00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.160
take that same dominant hand

435
00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.840
feel behind your neck lean your head

436
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.840
forward there's a big bone that pops out

437
00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.160
go to the left of that an inch to an

438
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.000
inch and a half and touch lightly like a

439
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.559
butterfly again it's that light touch

440
00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:11.679
that's registered in the body

441
00:19:11.679 --> 00:19:13.039
that's the ingredient

442
00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:16.080

actually practice the points watching

459
00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:54.400
one another doing it

460
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.400

465
00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.720
how to address tennis elbow so it's all

466
00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.440
quite simple i know to do bio touch you

467
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.919
know it's not this huge long drawn out

468
00:20:13.919 --> 00:20:16.480
process that you have to take years to

469
00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.559
do and you don't need anybody else you

470
00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:20.960
know once you touch you're affected i i

471
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.080
think it's about you really believing

472
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.679
that you can you have it within yourself

473
00:20:27.679 --> 00:20:30.000
to help someone else

474
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.039
because so much of our programming is

475
00:20:33.039 --> 00:20:34.559
oh i can't

476
00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:36.799

00:20:39.039 --> 00:20:41.600
do you have it and you've always had it

479
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.080
right there inside of you and if you

480
00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.240
want to have a belief in it

481
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.440
do it just do it have no expectations it

482
00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.280
ain't gonna kill you it ain't gonna cost

483
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.840
